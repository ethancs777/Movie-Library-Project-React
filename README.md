How to run:
1. Pull the repository locally into a folder of your choosing
2. In your terminal run "npm install"
3. Once all dependencies are installed you will now need to get an api key from https://www.themoviedb.org/
4. To get an api key create an account and navigate to account settings, here you will find a section labed API, then fill out the form and generate a key. 
5. Once you have your api key find the api.js file (./services/api.js)
6. Paste your api key in the API_KEY variable (blank by default to avoid users exposing their key)
7. Run the command "npm run dev" in your terminal after saving all the changes made above and it should be up and running! Just open the link provided by vite in the terminal.
